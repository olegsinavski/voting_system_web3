# Smart Contract
Write a smart contract that implements a voting system, with functions to
- add candidates, 
- start the voting process by admin,
- vote for a candidate, 
- end the voting process by admin,
- retrieve the number of votes for each candidate,
- retrieve the winning candidate.

Also write tests using ethers.js (or any other library of your choice) that verifies the following cases:
only the admin can start and end the voting process
once voting is done, it is reflected for the right candidate

# Frontend or Script
Create a basic frontend, which displays the candidates and the number of votes for each candidate, and allows users to vote. Connect the smart contract with the frontend using Ethers.js.
OR

Write a separate script with Ethers.js to interact with the smart contract functions.
Include a readme file.
